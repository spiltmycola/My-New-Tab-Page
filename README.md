# My-New-Tab-Page
Responsive custom new tab page displaying time, weather (for Sydney) and generating placeholder questions

To Use:
1. Get a OpenWeatherMap API Key
2. Replace the placeholder text with your API Key in 'config.js'
3. Go to 'chrome://extensions'
4. Check 'Developer Mode' if not already checked
5. Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the folder with the new tab page
  
To change pictures and text, edit 'main.js'. There is an array for questions and 2D array for backgrounds, [i][0] for link of source and [i][1] for position, e.g. "center top" else leave blank "".
  
Note:
- 'manifest.json' and instructions above are made for Google Chrome. Look elsewhere for how to use on other browsers.
