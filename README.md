# My-New-Tab-Page
Responsive custom new tab page displaying time, weather (for Sydney) and generating placeholder questions

To Use:
- Get a OpenWeatherMap API Key
- Replace the placeholder text with your API Key in 'config.js'
- Go to 'chrome://extensions'
- Check 'Developer Mode' if not already checked
- Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the folder with the new tab page
  
To change pictures and text, edit 'main.js'. I just use random variables and switch-case statements so it should be pretty easy.
  
Note:
- 'manifest.json' and instructions above are made for Google Chrome. Look elsewhere for how to use on other browsers.
